# Google Summer of Code 2016 Project ideas

The details of each of our project ideas are listed below, including potential
mentors. Interested mentors and students should subscribe to the OBF/GSoC
mailing list and announce their interest.

See the [main OBF Google Summer of Code page](../) for more information about the GSoC
program and additional ways to get in touch with us.

## Cross-project ideas

OBF is an umbrella organization which represents many different programming
languages used in bioinformatics. In addition to working with each of the
"Bio*" projects (listed below), this year we are also accepting a category of
"cross-project" ideas that cover multiple programming languages or projects.
These collaborative ideas are broadly defined and can be thought of as
"unfinished" â€” interested students should adapt the ideas to their own
strengths and goals, and are responsible for the quality of the final proposed
idea in their application.

**Feel free to propose your own entirely new idea.**


### Automated tool wrapper/converter for CWL

#### Rationale

The [Common Workflow Language](http://commonwl.org/) has so far defined a standard and a reference implementation to that standard, as opposed to the common practice of creating a system and then (not) trying to standardize it.

Defining [workflows](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/workflows) is a work in progress for CWL, but a more daunting task looms ahead of its adoption: wrapping tools.

Analogous to the packaging problem, we think that wrapping tools from already established systems such as Galaxy or Taverna is a task best done by machines. Unfortunately, there are no (automated) converters between those systems.

#### Approach

This project aims to solve part of that by taking [gxargparse](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/gxargparse), a proof of concept for the python tools command line ecosystem.

Internally, gxargparse, masquerading as argparse attempts to find and import the real argparse. 
It then stores a reference to the code module for the system argparse, and presents the user with all 
of the functions that stdlib argparse provides. Every function call is passed through the system argparse.

However, gxargparse captures the details of those calls and when a tool definition (Galaxy Tool XML in 
the case of the original code base) is requested, it builds up the tool definition according to community standards.

Another small proof of concept within the python ecosystem involves the docopt package and 
[rabixator](https://github.com/stefanristeski/rabixator). Furthermore, other similar instrumentation 
is being discussed to, for example, explore and optimize the parameter/flag space of i.e, bioinformatic
aligners with [Teaser](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0803-1).

Last but not least, if this approach could be generalized to tools written in other languages such as Java, 
C, Perl, among others, it would not only ease the migration of (bioinformatics) tools to newer workflow
systems, but for instance test the quality and robustness of several bioinformatics tools automatically.

### Nextflow integration with NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) 

#### Rationale

Truly reproducible computational analysis relies on the having the exact same software, computational environment and data available. [Nextflow](http://www.nextflow.io/) along with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) fulfills the software and environment requirements yet the data is kept distinct.

It now common practice that DNA and RNA sequencing data must be made available in the [NCBI Sequence Read Archive](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) (SRA). 
Integration of the SRA into Nextflow could allow users to reference, pull and analyse their or others read data in programmatic manner.
As an example, a user of pipeline could specify an SRA Study ID, for example the ID SRP003186 and have the mapping performed exactly as is specified in the study.

#### Approach 

The suggested approach consist in integrating the NCBI SRA toolkit into Nextflow in such a way that SRA entries can be accessed from a pipeline script extending the Nextflow built-in operators whenever necessary.

#### Languages and skills 

Student is required to have a good knowledge of the Java/C++ programming languages and some basic skills of NGS data analysis. 

#### Code

* [NCBI SRA toolkit](https://github.com/ncbi/ncbi-vdb)
* [NCBI NGS language binding](https://github.com/ncbi/ngs)

### Nextflow support for Common Workflow Language  

#### Rationale

[Nextflow](http://www.nextflow.io/) is a lightweight framework for computational pipelines. It implements a domain specific language (DSL) 
that simplifies writing parallel and scalable pipelines in a portable manner across different execution platform.    

The [Common Workflow Language](http://commonwl.org/) (CWL) is a community effort to create a standard specification to define and describe 
data analysis workflows that can be implemented by tools and platforms. 

This proposal aims to implement in Nextflow a support for the CWL. This would allow any CWL defined pipeline to be executable 
with the Nextflow pipeline framework increasing the interoperability of the tool with other frameworks and platforms.   

####  Approach 

The approach suggested consists in the implementation of a conversion tool able to parse a CWL pipeline definition 
and translate it to an equivalent Nextflow DSL script. At a first stage this tool can be prototyped in any programming 
language as an independent program. Then it is required to be written in Java/Groovy and to be integrated in the Nextflow codebase.

#### Languages and skills
Student is required to have a good knowledge of the Java and/or Groovy programming languages and basic concepts of parallel programming and computational workflows.

### Nextflow user interface 

#### Rationale 

[Nextflow](http://www.nextflow.io/) is a lightweight framework for computational pipelines. It implements a domain specific language (DSL) that 
simplifies writing parallel and scalable pipelines in a portable manner across different execution platform. 

Nextflowhas been developed as a command line oriented tool because this allows developers a faster prototyping and development 
cycle and simplify the application deployment process. However end-users may not have the required skills to operate 
with the *-nix command line required to manage and launch a Nextflow based data analysis workflow. 

The proposed idea is to developed a lean web user interface that allows users to launch and monitor the execution a 
Nextflow based pipeline.  

#### Approach 

The suggested approach consist in splitting the project goal in two main work packages. The first requires to implement 
a REST based API in the Nextflow execution engine that allows a remote application to access the runtime information of a 
running pipeline (list of submitted tasks, task status, task execution details, etc.)  and to operate with it (pause, 
stop, resume execution).

The second package requires to implement a web based dashboard application that would allow a user to connect to a remote 
Nextflow instance and control its execution status by using the above API. Ideally the dashboard application should 
self-contained and able to run without requiring a prior installation of external dependencies.  

#### Languages and skills 

The student is required to have proven ability with Javascript, HTML5, Polymer. Experience with API design and a good 
knowledge of the Groovy/Java programming languages.
