## Cross-project ideas

OBF is an umbrella organization which represents many different programming
languages used in bioinformatics. In addition to working with each of the
"Bio*" projects (listed below), this year we are also accepting a category of
"cross-project" ideas that cover multiple programming languages or projects.
These collaborative ideas are broadly defined and can be thought of as
"unfinished" â€” interested students should adapt the ideas to their own
strengths and goals, and are responsible for the quality of the final proposed
idea in their application.

**Feel free to propose your own entirely new idea.**
